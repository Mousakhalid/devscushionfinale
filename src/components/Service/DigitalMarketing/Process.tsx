            <p className="mb-4">
                Digital marketing should be integrated into the product development lifecycle from the outset. Why? 
                Because, by incorporating digital marketing strategies during the initial product strategy phase, 
                businesses can align their marketing efforts with their product goals, identify key market segments, 
                and refine their messaging to resonate with their target audience.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
                This proactive approach ensures that marketing initiatives are seamlessly integrated with product development, 
                resulting in a cohesive and effective digital marketing strategy.
